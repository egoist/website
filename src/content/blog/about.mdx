Hi, I go by EGOIST online, also known as ä½Žç©ºé£žè¡Œ, who is an indie hacker working on my own products. My biggest hobbies are football (the one played with actual foot) and anime, I also love coding because it's the only thing I'm good at.

My open-source work is funded by the [community](/donate) via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/egoist), if you use my code, please consider supporting me financially to help me keep doing what I love!

Have a nice day!
