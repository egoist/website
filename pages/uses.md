This is a list of things I use, inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

## Hardware

- Macbook Pro early 2015: buy Mac if you want to feel the heat!
- OnePlus 7: Best mid-range Android phone, 2019.


## Domain

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/domains): Vercel's domain search page is powerful and distraction-free, __I only use it to quickly find out if a domain is available__. 
- [domcomp](https://www.domcomp.com/): Comparing the price of multiple domain registrars.
- [Namesilo](https://namesilo.com): One of the cheapest domain registrar, free whois privacy service, supports refunds.
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com): Sometimes even cheaper than Namesilo, free whois privacy service, doesn't support refunds.

## Static Hosting

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): I use Vercel to deploy static sites and serverless functions, it's free for personal use and you can get a free plan for open source teams.
- [Render](https://render.com): I use Render to deploy static sites when I need to collaborate with a team, it has free plan for closed source projects.
- [~~Netlify~~](https://netlify.com): I no longer use Netlify, their [build minutes limit](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/faq/) [drived me crazy](https://twitter.com/_egoistlily/status/1252234217137688580?s=20).

## Backend Hosting

## Development
